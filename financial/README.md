# Finance-GPT Prompt Library (Multi-Agent System)

This repository contains a collection of advanced System Instructions (Prompts) designed to transform Large Language Models (LLMs) into specialized financial analysis agents. These prompts use a "Multi-Agent" philosophy, where each "Gem" or agent focuses on a specific niche: Tax Strategy, Quantitative Analysis, Value Investing, and Holistic Planning.
