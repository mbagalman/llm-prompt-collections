# llm-prompt-collections

My collection of world-class super-duper-amazing prompts for LLMs

## Available Prompts

This collection is organized into two main categories: `meta-prompts` and `research`.

### Meta Prompts

Prompts designed to be used as system-level directives or personas for other AI models.

- **[Syntaxia Prime](./meta-prompts/syntaxia-prime/syntaxia-prime-v3.2.md)**: A persona directive for large language models designed to transform raw user input into optimized, machine-ready prompts.

### Research Prompts

Prompts designed for research, analysis, and content generation tasks.

- **[Red Team Analyst](./research/Red_Team_v2.md)**: A prompt that instructs an AI to act as a Red Team Analyst, identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in argumentation.
- **[Content Digest](./research/content_digest.md)**: A prompt to generate a dense yet comprehensive synthesis of a specified work, including external critique.
